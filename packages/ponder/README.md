# Curyo — Ponder (Indexer & API)

On-chain event indexer built with [Ponder](https://ponder.sh/). Listens to smart contract events, stores processed data, and exposes a REST API on port 42069 for consumption by the frontend, bot, and AI/MCP adapters.

## Quick Start

```bash
# From the monorepo root:
cp packages/ponder/.env.example packages/ponder/.env.local
# Edit packages/ponder/.env.local with your RPC URL and network selection

yarn ponder:dev     # Development mode with file watching + auto-recovery, terminal UI disabled
yarn ponder:start   # Production mode (no file watching)
yarn ponder:codegen # Regenerate TypeScript types from schema
```

Requires a running chain (local via `yarn chain` or a configured testnet RPC).

## Scripts

| Command               | Description                                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `yarn ponder:dev`     | Development mode with crash recovery and terminal UI disabled |
| `yarn ponder:start`   | Production mode                                               |
| `yarn ponder:codegen` | Generate types from `ponder.schema.ts`                        |

Within the package directory, additional scripts are available:

| Command        | Description                                                     |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `yarn dev:raw` | Development mode without recovery wrapper, terminal UI disabled |
| `yarn dev:ui`  | Development mode with Ponder's live terminal UI enabled         |
| `yarn serve`   | Run API only (no indexing)                                      |

## Configuration

| Variable                                   | Description                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `PONDER_NETWORK`                           | Active network: `hardhat`, `celoSepolia`, or `celo`                                              |
| `PONDER_RPC_URL_31337`                     | RPC URL for local Hardhat/Anvil chain                                                            |
| `PONDER_RPC_URL_11142220`                  | RPC URL for Celo Sepolia                                                                         |
| `PONDER_RPC_URL_42220`                     | RPC URL for Celo mainnet                                                                         |
| `PONDER_CONTENT_REGISTRY_ADDRESS` etc.     | Local Hardhat address overrides; fallback addresses when the active chain has no shared deployment in `@curyo/contracts` |
| `PONDER_CONTENT_REGISTRY_START_BLOCK` etc. | Optional fallback start blocks when the active chain has no shared deployment metadata           |
| `CORS_ORIGIN`                              | Allowed origins (comma-separated; required in production)                                        |
| `RATE_LIMIT_TRUSTED_IP_HEADERS`            | Comma-separated proxy IP headers to trust for API rate limiting in production                    |

For live supported chains, Ponder treats `@curyo/contracts` as the source of truth and ignores stale address/start-block env values.
For local Hardhat/Anvil, Ponder prefers the address env values generated into `packages/ponder/.env.local` so a fresh
`yarn deploy` does not need machine-specific addresses committed to the shared deployment artifact. After `yarn deploy`,
the Foundry deployment script refreshes `packages/ponder/.env.local` to match the deployment target. Local deploys set
`PONDER_NETWORK=hardhat`; live deploys such as
`yarn deploy --network celoSepolia --keystore <name>` set the matching live network.

ABIs come from `@curyo/contracts/abis`; the indexer imports the shared package directly.

## API Endpoints

The REST API is built with Hono. Key routes:

| Endpoint                                | Description                                             |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /content`                          | List content with filters and pagination                |
| `GET /content/:id`                      | Single content item                                     |
| `GET /content/by-url?url=...`           | Look up a single content item by URL                    |
| `GET /votes`                            | List votes with filters                                 |
| `GET /question-reward-claim-candidates` | Claimable USDC bounty rounds for a revealed voter       |
| `GET /question-bundle-claim-candidates` | Claimable bundle bounty round sets for a revealed voter |
| `GET /profile/:address`                 | User profile and reputation                             |
| `GET /categories`                       | List content categories                                 |

Bounty tables track gross funding, voter payouts, and the default eligible frontend-operator share separately so API consumers can display both voter rewards and operator fees. Bundle bounties are indexed as round sets: each set records one settled round per bundled question, its allocation, and per-voter claims. Feedback Bonus tables stay separate: they index USDC pools, awarded feedback hashes, direct voter payments, frontend shares, and treasury forfeits. Content submission events now revolve around the required context URL plus optional preview media, so indexers and clients can treat the source link as the canonical entry point for discovery and previews.

Routes `/health` and `/status` are reserved by Ponder.

## Troubleshooting

**Local chain rewind / reset:** `yarn ponder:dev` now auto-recovers once if the local hardhat/anvil chain was reset and the persisted Ponder checkpoint points at a block that no longer exists. It clears `packages/ponder/.ponder/pglite` and retries automatically.

**PGlite corruption or unrecoverable local state:** If Ponder still crashes or behaves unexpectedly after the retry, clear the local state manually:

```bash
rm -rf packages/ponder/.ponder
```

**BigInt serialization:** Always use `replaceBigInts()` from `"ponder"` before calling `c.json()` in API routes — `JSON.stringify` cannot serialize BigInt values.

**Rate limiting behind proxies:** In production, set `RATE_LIMIT_TRUSTED_IP_HEADERS` only to headers your edge proxy overwrites, such as `x-forwarded-for` on Vercel/Railway behind a trusted proxy or `cf-connecting-ip` on Cloudflare. If you leave it unset, Ponder falls back to a request fingerprint instead of skipping rate limiting.
