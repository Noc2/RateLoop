# RateLoop Agent Examples

These examples keep one loop stable across runtimes:

1. quote before spending
2. prepare an ask with a stable `clientRequestId`
3. wait through a signed callback or poll status
4. fetch the structured result
5. store `publicUrl`, `operationKey`, and the outcome in memory or logs

## Recommended First Demo

Use the landing-page pitch checkpoint for mechanics, or `questions/ai-website-feedback-service.json` when testing an AI
website-generation service concept:

- Draft a short landing-page pitch.
- Ask RateLoop: `Would this pitch make you want to learn more?`
- Wait for the structured result.
- Revise when the answer is `revise` or confidence is low.
- Continue when the answer is `proceed`.

That keeps the integration narrow while still exercising quote, ask, wait, result, and memory writes.

When a coding agent has built a public preview and needs users to test whether it works, use
`questions/feature-acceptance-test.json`. It keeps the vote binary while asking voters to follow explicit test steps and
leave reproducible failure notes in feedback.

When comparing options, do not ask one multiple-choice question. Use `ranked_option_member` or
`pairwise_output_preference`, submit one question per option in the same bundle, then compare the settled ratings.

## First Funded Ask

Before the first paid ask, fund the configured `walletAddress` with World Chain USDC. In the public MCP flow, quote with
`rateloop_quote_question`, then call `rateloop_ask_humans` to prepare the ask. Execute the returned `transactionPlan.calls` in
order; the plan includes USDC approval, submission reservation, and question submission. Finish by sending the
transaction hashes to `rateloop_confirm_ask_transactions`. Example bounty amounts are atomic USDC units, and
`rewardPoolExpiresAt` should be a future Unix timestamp for the review window. Managed agents can also call
`rateloop_get_agent_balance`, use signed callbacks, and rely on RateLoop-enforced per-ask or daily caps.

For single-question MCP asks, add an optional `feedbackBonus` when written feedback is useful enough to reward
separately from the rating. Set `maxPaymentAmount` to cover bounty plus bonus. After the ask is confirmed, execute any
returned `feedbackBonus.transactionPlan.calls` and send those hashes to `rateloop_confirm_feedback_bonus_transactions`.

The public MCP config is enough for accountless use. In a chat-hosted runtime, the agent should ask the user for the
funded `walletAddress`, the public context URL, image context, or YouTube video context, the bounty budget, and whether the user wants to approve spend through a
browser signing link or let a local signer execute the returned calls. Creating a RateLoop account is optional and only
needed for managed policies, saved tokens, callbacks, balance tooling, or audit exports.

## Runtime Notes

### OpenClaw

- Use `openclaw.mcpServers.json` as the starting point.
- Start with the public MCP config when the agent already controls a funded wallet.
- Add bearer tokens scoped to `rateloop:quote`, `rateloop:ask`, `rateloop:read`, and `rateloop:balance` only when you want managed caps or callbacks.
- Keep daily and per-ask budget caps small until the managed loop has proven stable.
- Write `operationKey`, `clientRequestId`, `publicUrl`, and `answer` into memory so the agent can avoid duplicate asks.

### Hermes

- Hermes can use the same remote MCP shape as OpenClaw.
- Store `operationKey`, `publicUrl`, `answer`, `confidence`, and any `cohortSummary` or `liveAskGuidance` fields in memory for later planning.
- Prefer callbacks for wakeups, but treat `getQuestionStatus` and `getResult` as the source of truth before acting.

### ChatGPT and Claude

- Use a remote connector or remote MCP wrapper that can call the same quote, ask, status, and result surfaces.
- Present quote output clearly before the host approves spend.
- Use the same landing-page pitch demo first so the branching logic stays easy to inspect in conversation.

### Gemini CLI and local coding agents

- Use `generic-public-mcp.json` for wallet-direct asks, or `gemini-cli.mcpServers.json` / `generic-remote-mcp.json` for managed token flows.
- Prefer polling over a local callback unless your runtime already exposes a webhook receiver.
- Write the returned `publicUrl` into the task log or session memory so later steps can cite the human checkpoint.

### Backend workers

- Start from `landing-pitch-review.ts`.
- Use `RATELOOP_API_BASE_URL` plus a funded `RATELOOP_AGENT_WALLET_ADDRESS` for public direct HTTP, or add a managed MCP token for RateLoop-enforced caps.
- Prepare the ask, execute the approved wallet calls with a user-scoped session key, then confirm the transaction hashes.
- Keep live asks stable after submission. If response is weak, top up additively or retry later instead of mutating the existing market.
