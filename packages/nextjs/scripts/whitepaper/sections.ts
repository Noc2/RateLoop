It is count-based and governance-tunable: the initial earned-rater policy requires three revealed raters, one verified-human anchor in the round, and two distinct verified-human anchors across a rater's qualifying history before payout. Earned-rater caps start at 10 LREP and step down through 5, 2.5, 1.25, and 0.5 LREP, supporting about 12.6M fully paid earned-rater recipients from the 25M LREP rail. Early useful raters receive higher caps, later cohorts receive less, and verified users receive only a one-time decaying bonus. The previous 12M LREP Bootstrap Pool allocation is folded into launch distribution: 10M LREP moved to verified + referral rewards, and 2M LREP moved to legacy users. The treasury starts with 32M LREP under the governance timelock and handles safety responses, verification acceleration, appeals, grants, and other governed programs. The bootstrap proposal threshold is 1,000 LREP with a minimum quorum floor of 100,000 LREP.",
