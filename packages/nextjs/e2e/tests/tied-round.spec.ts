/**
 * Tied round lifecycle test (tlock commit-reveal).
 * Verifies that when upStake === downStake the round settles as Tied (state=3),
 * the content rating does NOT change, and rewards are handled correctly.
 *
 * Strategy:
 * 1. Ask a fresh question directly to get a clean round with 0 votes
 * 2. 4 accounts vote on the SAME content via UI: 2 UP + 2 DOWN, all 1 LREP
 *    (UI voting uses commitVote correctly via hooks)
 * 3. Fast-forward past epoch → keeper reveals via keeper API → fast-forward → settle
 * 4. Verify round.state === 3 (Tied) and rating unchanged
 *
 * Account allocation:
 * - Account #10 — submits new content
 * - Accounts #3, #4 — vote UP (1 LREP each)
 * - Accounts #5, #6 — vote DOWN (1 LREP each)
 *
 * NOTE: Uses accounts that may already have cooldowns from settlement-lifecycle
 * and reward-claim tests. The test asks a fresh question directly to avoid
 * submission UI timing while still exercising UI voting.
