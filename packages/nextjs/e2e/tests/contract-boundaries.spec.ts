/**
 * Contract boundary tests — verifies on-chain reverts for invalid operations.
 *
 * Uses direct contract calls (no browser/UI) to test edge cases with commitVote:
 * 1. Commit with stake below MIN_STAKE (1 HREP) → InvalidStake
 * 2. Commit with stake above MAX_STAKE (100 HREP) → InvalidStake
 * 3. Self-vote (submitter commits on own content) → SelfVote
 * 4. Double commit in same round → AlreadyCommitted
 *
 * Account allocation:
 * - Account #2 — submitter of seeded content #1 (self-vote test)
 * - Account #3 — voter for boundary tests
 * - Account #4 — voter for double-commit test
 * - Account #10 — submits fresh content for double-commit test
