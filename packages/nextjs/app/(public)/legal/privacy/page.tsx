        <h1>Privacy Notice</h1>
        <p className="readability-meta">Last updated: April 2026</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This Privacy Notice explains how this interface (&quot;the Interface&quot;), operated by Hawig Ventures UG
          (haftungsbeschr&auml;nkt), Herzogin-Juliana-Stra&szlig;e 7, 55469 Simmern, Germany (&quot;we&quot;,
          &quot;us&quot;, &quot;the data controller&quot;), handles information when you use it to access the RateLoop
          Protocol. We are committed to transparency about our data practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Important Distinction:</strong> This Privacy Notice applies only to this Interface (the website). The
          RateLoop Protocol is a set of decentralized smart contracts that operate independently on the blockchain. The
          Interface operator does not control the Protocol and cannot access, modify, or delete any data recorded on the
          blockchain.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Protocol Data vs Interface Data</h2>

        <h3>2.1 Protocol Data (Blockchain - NOT Controlled by Us)</h3>
        <p>
          When you interact with the RateLoop Protocol through any interface, the following information is recorded
          directly on the public blockchain:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your wallet address</li>
          <li>Voting transactions (stakes, votes, claims)</li>
          <li>Content submission transactions</li>
          <li>
            Public profile data, including profile names and any self-reported audience context you choose to save
          </li>
          <li>Transaction timestamps and amounts</li>
          <li>Smart contract interaction history</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Important:</strong> Blockchain data is permanent, public, and immutable. Neither this Interface nor
          any other party can modify or delete this data. This data exists independently of this Interface and would
          continue to exist even if this Interface ceased to operate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Profile audience context is self-reported and unverified. It may include broad categories such as age group,
          country, nationalities, languages, roles, or experience areas, and may be read by humans, AI systems, and
          public indexing tools. It is not used to restrict voting eligibility.
        </p>

        <h3>2.2 Interface Data (Controlled by Us)</h3>
        <p>This Interface may collect or process the following information:</p>

            <strong>Browser Storage Data:</strong> Terms acceptance status, onboarding state, interface preferences,
            temporary wallet-display and notification state, referral information, locally tracked content-interaction
            data, and similar functional data stored in your browser via local storage or session storage.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Wallet-Linked Application Data:</strong> Watchlist entries, followed wallet addresses, notification
            preferences, and related timestamps needed to provide those features.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Signed Authorization Data:</strong> Short-lived signature challenges and read/write session records
            used to authorize wallet-bound features. These records may include wallet address, feature scope, nonce or
            token material, payload hashes, and creation/expiry timestamps.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Agent Wallet Data:</strong> Agent policy metadata, wallet addresses, spend caps, category
            allowlists, operation keys, transaction hashes, callback URLs, delivery status, and audit timestamps needed
            to prepare, confirm, and recover agent asks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Uploaded Image Context:</strong> If you upload images for an ask, we process the file, filename,
            MIME type, size, checksum, uploader wallet or agent identifier, moderation status, generated storage paths,
            derived dimensions, and related timestamps needed to validate, moderate, store, serve, and associate the
            image with a public question.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Email Notification Data (Optional):</strong> If you enable email notifications, we process your
            email address, notification preferences, verification status, verification token, and related timestamps.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Security and Abuse-Prevention Data:</strong> Temporary rate-limit and replay-protection records,
            which may be derived from trusted IP headers or fallback request fingerprints plus route metadata.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Aggregate Analytics Data:</strong> We use Simple Analytics for privacy-preserving, cookieless,
            aggregate site usage metrics. Simple Analytics is EU-based and does not use cookies or cross-site tracking.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.3 What We Do NOT Collect</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>This Interface does not use advertising analytics, cross-site tracking, or analytics cookies.</strong>{" "}
          We do use limited, strictly-necessary cookies or similar session tokens for wallet-bound features such as
          watchlists, follows, and notification settings. These cookies are used for security and feature operation, not
          for cross-site tracking or advertising.
        </p>
        <p>This Interface also does not collect:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Name, phone number, postal address, or similar offline contact details</li>
          <li>Passport, government ID, biometric, or document contents from World ID or other identity providers</li>
          <li>Advertising or cross-site behavioral tracking profiles</li>
          <li>Biometric data</li>
          <li>Your wallet private keys, seed phrases, or custody of your assets</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>

        <p>If you opt into email notifications, we use your email-related data to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Store your chosen delivery address and notification preferences</li>
          <li>Send verification emails and verify control of the address</li>
          <li>Deliver product emails that you explicitly enabled</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.4 Security and Abuse Prevention</h3>
        <p>Security-related data is used to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Rate-limit API endpoints</li>
          <li>Prevent replay or reuse of signed authorization challenges</li>
          <li>Investigate operational issues and protect the Interface from abuse</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.5 Legal Bases</h3>
        <p>Where GDPR applies, we rely on the following legal bases for Interface-controlled data:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Contract or steps requested by you:</strong> Processing needed to provide wallet-bound features,
            prepare and confirm asks, operate agent wallet flows, deliver requested notifications, and remember Terms
            acceptance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> Security, abuse prevention, rate limiting, debugging, replay
            protection, aggregate privacy-preserving analytics, service reliability, and legal or operational audit
            trails.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Consent:</strong> Optional email notifications and other optional features where the Interface asks
            for separate permission. You can withdraw that consent by disabling the relevant feature or contacting us.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legal obligations:</strong> Processing needed to respond to lawful requests, sanctions or compliance
            checks, disputes, accounting, tax, or other obligations that may apply to the Interface operator.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The Interface may interact with the following third-party services:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Simple Analytics:</strong> We use Simple Analytics for cookieless, privacy-preserving aggregate site
            usage metrics. It does not set analytics cookies or build cross-site behavioral profiles.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Blockchain RPC Providers:</strong> To read and write blockchain data (e.g., Alchemy, Infura, or
            similar). These providers may have their own privacy policies regarding request logging.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Wallet Providers:</strong> When you connect your wallet (e.g., MetaMask, WalletConnect, Rainbow),
            those services have their own data practices. We recommend reviewing their privacy policies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Hosting Provider:</strong> Our frontend is hosted on infrastructure that may collect standard server
            logs (IP addresses, request timestamps). These logs are typically retained for 30-90 days and used only for
            security and debugging purposes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Content Delivery Networks:</strong> We may use CDNs to deliver static assets, which may process
            requests according to their own policies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Email Delivery Provider (Resend):</strong> If you enable email notifications, verification and
            notification emails may be delivered through Resend, which processes your email address and the email
            content needed to deliver that message.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Image Storage and Moderation Providers:</strong> Uploaded image context may be stored with Vercel
            Blob and may be sent to OpenAI or similar content-safety providers for automated moderation before it is
            served as public question context.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Optional Identity Providers:</strong> If an interface offers optional credentials, trust badges, or
            eligibility checks, the provider may process identity information under its own privacy policy. RateLoop
            should only receive the credential result or on-chain proof required for the feature, not your underlying
            document data.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
        <ul>

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Uploaded image context:</strong> Approved images may be retained and cached while they are needed to
            display the public ask or result; rejected or raw upload files may be deleted after processing, moderation,
            abuse review, or operational cleanup
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Signed read sessions:</strong> Up to 1 year; <strong>signed write sessions:</strong> up to 7 days

          <li>
            <strong>
              x402 submissions, transaction hashes, payment receipts, callback URLs, and ask operation records:
            </strong>{" "}
            As long as needed to prepare, confirm, recover, audit, or explain the ask lifecycle, and then according to
            operational cleanup and legal-retention needs
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Email notification subscriptions:</strong> Until you remove or replace the address; verification
            tokens expire after 24 hours
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Rate-limit records:</strong> Until the applicable rate-limit window expires
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Server logs:</strong> Retained according to hosting provider policies (typically 30-90 days)
          </li>

        <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Due to the nature of blockchain technology and our minimal data collection:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Right to Access:</strong> All blockchain data is publicly accessible through any blockchain
            explorer. Browser storage data can be viewed in your browser&apos;s developer tools. Server-side feature
            data tied to optional interface features may be requested from us where applicable.

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Right to Deletion:</strong> Blockchain data cannot be deleted by anyone. Browser storage can be
            cleared by you at any time through your browser settings. Optional server-side interface data such as
            follows, watchlists, and notification settings can be removed through the Interface or by contacting us
            where applicable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Right to Portability:</strong> You maintain full control of your wallet and can use it with any
            compatible service or interface.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Right to Object:</strong> You may stop using this Interface at any time. The Protocol remains
            accessible through other means.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For users in the European Union and Germany: Given that we do not collect or store personal data beyond what
          is described above, most rights under the GDPR and the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) are either
          automatically satisfied or not applicable. If you have specific privacy concerns, please contact us at
          hawigxyz@proton.me or lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority. For our registered office in
          Rhineland-Palatinate, the responsible authority is:

        <h2>7. Security</h2>
        <p>
          We implement reasonable security measures for our frontend infrastructure. However, the security of your
          tokens and wallet depends entirely on your own security practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>We strongly recommend:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Using hardware wallets for significant holdings</li>
          <li>Never sharing your private keys or seed phrases with anyone</li>
          <li>Verifying you are on the correct website before connecting your wallet</li>
          <li>Carefully reviewing all transaction details before signing</li>
          <li>Being cautious of phishing attempts and fake interfaces</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Children&apos;s Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          The Service is not intended for users under 18 years of age (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction). We
          do not knowingly collect information from minors. If you believe a minor has accessed the Service, please
          contact us.
        </p>

        <h2>9. International Users</h2>
        <p>
          This Interface is operated from Germany. If you access the Interface from other regions, please be aware that
          information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in Germany or other jurisdictions where our service
          providers operate, including hosting, RPC, CDN, and email delivery providers.
        </p>
        <p>
          By using the Interface, you consent to such transfers. We note that blockchain data is stored on a globally
          distributed network and is not localized to any single jurisdiction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where GDPR requires transfer safeguards for service providers outside the European Economic Area, we rely on
          the provider&apos;s applicable data-processing terms, adequacy decisions, standard contractual clauses, or
          other lawful transfer mechanisms.
        </p>
