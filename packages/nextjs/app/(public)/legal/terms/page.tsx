        <p className="readability-meta">Last updated: June 2026</p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>
          This Interface is operated by Hawig Ventures UG (haftungsbeschr&auml;nkt), Herzogin-Juliana-Stra&szlig;e 7,
          55469 Simmern, Germany (&quot;the Interface Operator&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot;). By accessing or
          using this interface to interact with the RateLoop Protocol (&quot;the Service&quot;), you agree to be bound
          by these Terms of Service and the{" "}
          <Link href="/legal/privacy" className="link link-primary">
            Privacy Notice
          </Link>
          . If you do not agree to these terms, do not use the Service.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Protocol vs Interface Distinction</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>RateLoop Protocol</strong> refers to a set of smart contracts deployed on blockchain networks.
          Depending on the specific contract and deployment, the Protocol may include governance, administrative, pause,
          or upgrade mechanisms defined on-chain. The Protocol generally:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Can be accessed without this Interface</li>
          <li>Records transactions independently of this Interface once they are submitted on-chain</li>
          <li>
            May continue to function even if this Interface is unavailable, subject to blockchain, governance, and
            protocol-level dependencies
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>This Interface</strong> (the website at this domain) is merely one way to access and interact with the
          RateLoop Protocol. The Interface operator:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Does not have custody of your tokens at any time</li>
          <li>Cannot reverse, modify, or intervene in your transactions once they are finalized on-chain</li>
          <li>
            Is not necessarily the only party with protocol-related governance, admin, pause, or upgrade permissions
          </li>
          <li>Is not responsible for the Protocol&apos;s operation or outcomes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You may interact with the RateLoop Protocol through other interfaces, directly via blockchain explorers, or
          through smart contract calls. The existence of this Interface does not create any special relationship between
          you and the Interface operator.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>The Service is NOT available to:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Persons under the age of 18 (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction)</li>
          <li>Persons in any jurisdiction where blockchain or decentralized application services are prohibited</li>
          <li>Persons subject to sanctions or unable to pass configured sanctioned-country eligibility checks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you meet all eligibility requirements and are legally
          permitted to use the Service in your jurisdiction. The availability of this Interface does not constitute an
          offer or solicitation in any jurisdiction where such offer would be unlawful.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Token Usage</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>You acknowledge and agree that:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>LREP tokens are reputation tokens used for content curation and governance within the Protocol</li>
          <li>
            LREP tokens have no protocol-backed redemption value, no claim on revenue or assets, and are not intended as
            an investment
          </li>
          <li>You may lose tokens through normal Protocol operation (e.g., incorrect curation predictions)</li>
          <li>There is no guarantee of any particular outcomes from your participation</li>
          <li>Historical outcomes do not indicate or guarantee future results</li>
          <li>The Interface operator has no liability for any token losses you incur</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Nothing in the Service is an offer to buy or sell securities, financial instruments, deposits, e-money, or
          investment products. LREP does not represent equity, debt, revenue sharing, dividends, redemption rights, or
          any right to the assets of the Interface operator or the Protocol.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Risk Disclosures</h2>
        <div className="alert alert-info my-4">
          <span className="font-bold">
            IMPORTANT: Using the RateLoop Protocol involves significant risks. Please read this section carefully.
          </span>
        </div>

        <h3>5.1 Smart Contract Risks</h3>
        <p>
          The RateLoop Protocol operates through smart contracts deployed on blockchain networks. Smart contracts carry
          inherent and significant risks:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Bugs and Vulnerabilities:</strong> Despite audits and testing, smart contracts may contain
            undiscovered bugs, vulnerabilities, or exploits that could result in partial or total loss of tokens
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Contract Design and Governance:</strong> Some contracts may be immutable, while others may include
            governance-controlled pause or upgrade mechanisms. Those mechanisms can fail, be misused, or introduce new
            risks
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Upgrade Risks:</strong> Upgrades or other governance actions may change contract behavior,
            permissions, or economics, and may fail or be executed maliciously
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Economic Attacks:</strong> The Protocol may be susceptible to economic attacks, flash loan attacks,
            oracle manipulation, or other exploit vectors
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dependency Risks:</strong> The Protocol depends on external systems including blockchain networks,
            oracles, and other protocols which may fail or be compromised
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.2 Blockchain Technology Risks</h3>
        <p>Using blockchain technology involves inherent risks:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Irreversibility:</strong> Blockchain transactions are final and irreversible. Errors cannot be
            undone
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Network Risks:</strong> Blockchain networks may experience congestion, forks, reorganizations,
            attacks, or complete failures
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Gas Costs:</strong> You are responsible for all network transaction fees (gas), which can be
            significant during periods of network congestion
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Wallet Security:</strong> You are solely responsible for securing your wallet, private keys, and
            seed phrases. Lost keys cannot be recovered
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Phishing and Scams:</strong> You may encounter phishing websites, malicious contracts, or scams
            impersonating the RateLoop Protocol
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.3 Operational Risks</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Curation is Not Advice:</strong> Content ratings and curation outcomes are community-driven and do
            not constitute recommendations or endorsements
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reward Variability:</strong> Token rewards depend on various factors and are not guaranteed
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Interface Availability:</strong> This Interface may become unavailable, but the Protocol will
            continue to operate independently
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Optional Identity Signals:</strong> The core rating path does not require proof-of-personhood.
            Future or legacy identity integrations may use third-party credentials for abuse prevention, eligibility, or
            interface badges. Those providers have their own availability, privacy, and compliance risks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Agent Automation:</strong> If you authorize an automated agent, smart-wallet session key, or scoped
            agent wallet, you are responsible for the spend caps, permissions, credentials, and transactions that agent
            signs or causes to be signed
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>
          RateLoop is a decentralized content curation protocol that allows users to stake reputation tokens to vote on
          content quality. The Protocol enables:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Submission of content URLs for community curation</li>
          <li>Staking LREP tokens to vote on content quality (upvote/downvote)</li>
          <li>Distribution of token rewards based on curation outcomes</li>
          <li>Governance participation through token holding</li>
          <li>Optional identity credentials that an interface may display or use for additional trust context</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>The Service is NOT:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A gambling or betting platform</li>
          <li>A financial product or investment vehicle</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Submission and bounty features are question-first: a submission may be text-only or include public URL, image,
          or YouTube video context, and the submission must attach a non-refundable bounty funded in LREP or USDC on
          World Chain. A default frontend-operator share may be reserved from qualified claims when the vote was
          attributed to an eligible frontend. Bounty funds are sent from your connected wallet, smart wallet, or
          user-authorized agent wallet directly to protocol smart contracts; the Interface operator does not custody
          those bounty funds. The Interface does not impose a hard bounty cap, but it may apply moderation,
          duplicate-detection, media-type, and eligibility checks before a submission is accepted or a claim is
          processed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bounty payouts within each qualified bounty round are split among eligible revealed voters pro-rata by
          protocol-defined claim weights (equal weights, or surprise-and-correlation-weighted snapshot weights,
          depending on the round), and claims remain gated by the relevant protocol checks. These guardrails are
          intended to reduce spam, preserve Sybil resistance, and keep the submission surface narrow.
        </p>
        <p>
          LREP or USDC bounties, feedback bonuses, and any other reward surfaces are task or participation payments, not
          investment returns. They may be unavailable, delayed, reduced, rejected, forfeited, or unclaimable because of
          protocol rules, eligibility checks, fraud or abuse review, sanctions or compliance screening, smart-contract
          risk, network fees, network failure, stablecoin issuer risk, or tax and reporting obligations.
        </p>

        <h2>7. User Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>You are solely responsible for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Maintaining the security of your wallet, private keys, and seed phrases</li>

          <li>All activities authorized through your agent credentials, scoped smart wallets, or session keys</li>
          <li>Ensuring your use of the Service complies with all applicable laws in your jurisdiction</li>
          <li>Understanding the risks involved in using blockchain technology and smart contracts</li>
          <li>Any taxes, reporting obligations, or regulatory compliance arising from your use of the Service</li>
          <li>Conducting your own due diligence before participating</li>
          <li>Verifying you are interacting with the legitimate Interface and Protocol</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Prohibited Uses</h2>
        <p>You agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide false information regarding your identity or eligibility</li>
          <li>Attempt to manipulate content ratings through coordinated or automated activity</li>
          <li>
            Submit fake reviews, undisclosed insider feedback, manipulated feedback, or misleading paid endorsements
          </li>
          <li>Ask questions with content that violates intellectual property rights</li>
          <li>Ask questions with content that is illegal, harmful, or violates platform guidelines</li>
          <li>Interfere with or disrupt the Service or its infrastructure</li>
          <li>Use the Service for money laundering, terrorist financing, or other illicit activities</li>
          <li>Exploit bugs, vulnerabilities, or errors in the Protocol or Interface</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. No Fiduciary Duty</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>
            The Interface operator, Protocol developers, and any associated parties owe NO fiduciary duties to you.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>This means:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>There is no duty of care owed to you</li>
          <li>There is no duty of loyalty owed to you</li>
          <li>There is no duty of disclosure beyond what is provided in these Terms</li>
          <li>Your use of the Service is at arm&apos;s length</li>
          <li>No advisor-client or similar professional relationship is created</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You should consult qualified legal and tax professionals before using the Protocol. Nothing in the Service
          constitutes professional advice of any kind.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
          The Interface&apos;s code, design, and branding are the property of the Interface operator or its licensors.
          The RateLoop Protocol smart contracts may be open source under their respective licenses.
        </p>
        <p>
          User-provided content remains the property of the original creators. By asking questions with content URLs or
          uploaded image context, you represent that you have the right to share such content and that doing so does not
          violate any third-party rights.
        </p>
        <p>
          Uploaded image context is intended only for material you are allowed to make public. The Interface may
          validate, transform, moderate, reject, store, cache, display, or remove uploaded media to operate the Service,
          protect users, comply with law, and enforce these Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some questions may use RateLoop-hosted confidential context. Access to that material is governed by separate{" "}
          <Link href="/confidential-context/terms" className="link link-primary">
            Confidential Context Access Terms
          </Link>{" "}
          that are designed as protocol-facing gated-context terms rather than operator-specific Terms of Service. You
          may be asked to sign those terms with your wallet before viewing hosted gated context.
        </p>
        <p>
          Questions, ratings, feedback, and other public submissions may be bounty-funded or otherwise compensated. You
          must not use the Service to create fake social proof, hide material conflicts of interest, or misrepresent
          paid or bounty-eligible feedback as independent unpaid endorsement.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Third-Party Content</h2>
        <p>
          The RateLoop Protocol indexes and displays links to third-party content. We do not endorse, verify, or take
          responsibility for the accuracy, legality, quality, or safety of any external content. Accessing external
          links is entirely at your own risk.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may remove, hide, restrict, or refuse to serve questions, media, feedback, links, profiles, or other
          content that appears illegal, rights-infringing, abusive, deceptive, spammy, unsafe, or inconsistent with
          these Terms. You can contact us at hawigxyz@proton.me about illegal content notices, moderation decisions, or
          legal requests.
        </p>

        <h2>12. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>
          THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS
          OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:

          TO THE INTERFACE OPERATOR IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.
        </p>
        <p>
          You acknowledge that smart contracts may contain bugs or vulnerabilities, and you accept the risk of loss
          associated with interacting with such contracts. This limitation applies regardless of the theory of
          liability.
        </p>

        <h2>14. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>
          You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Interface operator, its affiliates, and their respective
          officers, directors, employees, contractors, and agents from and against any claims, damages, losses,
          liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&apos; fees) arising from:

          the Federal Republic of Germany, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Jurisdiction:</strong> For any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the
          Service, the courts of Germany shall have jurisdiction. If you are a consumer within the EU, you may also
          bring proceedings in the courts of your place of residence.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Class Action Waiver:</strong> TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AGREE THAT ANY CLAIMS
          MUST BE BROUGHT IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR
          REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
        </p>

        <h2>16. Acknowledgment of Risks</h2>
        <p>By using the RateLoop Protocol through this Interface, you explicitly acknowledge and accept:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You have read and understood all risks described in these Terms</li>
          <li>You are using the Protocol and this Interface entirely at your own risk</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>17. Modifications</h2>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Changes will be effective upon posting to the
          Interface. Material changes will require re-acceptance through the Terms acceptance modal. Your continued use
          of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the modified Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          We recommend reviewing these Terms periodically. The &quot;Last updated&quot; date at the top indicates when
          the Terms were last revised.
        </p>

        <h2>18. Severability</h2>
        <p>
          If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions
