# Curyo — Next.js (Frontend)

Full-stack web application built with Next.js 15 and React 19. Provides the UI for voting on content, question-first submissions with a required context URL, optional image or YouTube preview media, governed per-question round settings, managing profiles, and reading in-app documentation. Question submissions must attach a non-refundable bounty funded in LREP or USDC, while claim flows remain tied to Voter ID where the protocol still requires it. Humans, bots, and AI agents all submit through the same question-first path. The app includes server-side API routes plus a PostgreSQL database via Drizzle ORM.

## Quick Start

```bash
# From the monorepo root:
yarn dev:stack   # Start local Postgres, apply schema, then run Next.js + Ponder, plus Keeper when configured
```

Deployment stays separate, so you can point the app stack at either a local chain or a testnet. For local-chain development, keep `yarn chain` and `yarn deploy` separate. Use `yarn dev:db:down` to stop the local Postgres container when you are done.

## Scripts

Run these from the monorepo root unless noted otherwise:

| Command                                         | Description                                                                                |

| `yarn start`                                    | Start development server (localhost:3000)                                                  |

| `yarn workspace @rateloop/nextjs demo:record`      | Record the short Playwright product demo video                                             |
| `yarn e2e`                                      | Run the Playwright smoke suite (Chromium)                                                  |

CI runs the smoke, lifecycle, and keeper-backed suites separately, so `yarn e2e` is only the smallest browser pass.

## Demo Recorder

To generate the shortest scripted product walkthrough video, start the local chain, deploy contracts, and run the app stack first:

```bash
yarn chain
yarn deploy
yarn dev:stack
```

Then record the demo:

```bash
yarn workspace @rateloop/nextjs demo:record
```

The recorder saves a `.webm` file under `packages/nextjs/e2e/artifacts/demo/`. Set `CURYO_DEMO_HEADLESS=false` if you want to watch the browser while it records, or `CURYO_DEMO_VIDEO_PATH=/absolute/path/demo.webm` to override the output file location.

## Configuration

Notes:

- Browser RPC reads prefer `NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL_<chainId>` overrides first, then `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY`, then the chain's default public RPC list.
- The target-network parser accepts local Foundry plus World Chain Sepolia and mainnet: `31337`, `4801`, and `480`.
- The Wallet settings tab uses thirdweb's BuyWidget to add native ETH for World Chain gas. Configure the thirdweb client ID's allowed domains for the production and preview origins that will render `/settings#wallet`.
- The Identity settings tab uses World ID v4 proof requests and server-side Developer Portal verification. Rating, rewards, and governance remain usable without this optional credential.
- `/api/mcp/public` exposes tokenless quote, ask, confirm, status, result, template, and category tools for agents that already control a funded wallet. `/api/mcp` remains the managed endpoint for bearer-token policies, balances, signed callbacks, and audit surfaces.
- Agent clients should follow the AI docs flow: list templates, quote with `walletAddress`, ask with a stable client request ID, execute and confirm wallet calls, wait for a status read or signed managed callback, then fetch the structured result. Operator token lifecycle, scopes, budgets, category allowlists, callback recovery, and audit history belong in `/settings?tab=agents` for managed agents; static `CURYO_MCP_AGENTS` remains supported for server-configured policies.
- The Ask page can host JPG, PNG, and WEBP image context through private Vercel Blob uploads. Uploaded images are validated, metadata-stripped into WEBP, moderated with OpenAI, and served through `/api/attachments/images/{attachmentId}.webp` only after approval. Agents should recommend this route when users have local mockups, screenshots, or generated images instead of asking them to find a third-party image host.
- Private artifacts, embargoed asks, restricted voter-only context, and delayed result disclosure are deferred. Current agent flows should assume public context URLs, public submitted questions, and public settled result pages.
- No core contract address env vars are needed for supported chains. The frontend reads core deployment metadata from `@rateloop/contracts` and fails fast if `NEXT_PUBLIC_TARGET_NETWORKS` includes a chain without those definitions; rollout contracts such as question reward pools can use their documented env fallbacks until generated metadata catches up.
- In production, the intended setup is one Railway Postgres service with separate logical databases for Ponder and Next.js.
- If your Postgres provider terminates TLS with a private or self-signed chain, append `uselibpqcompat=true&sslmode=require` to `DATABASE_URL` to opt out of the app's default `verify-full` normalization.
- For local development, `yarn dev:db` and `yarn dev:stack` manage a Docker Postgres container when `DATABASE_URL` points to localhost. `yarn dev:stack` only runs `db:push` automatically for local databases; non-local databases require a manual `yarn workspace @rateloop/nextjs db:push` or the explicit `CURYO_DEV_STACK_ALLOW_REMOTE_DB_PUSH=1` opt-in.
- On Next.js 15, `NextRequest.ip` is not reliably populated. On non-Vercel production hosts you must configure `RATE_LIMIT_TRUSTED_IP_HEADERS` to the header(s) your hosting proxy overwrites. Vercel auto-trusts `x-real-ip`, and localhost shortcuts are only enabled for development or explicit local production-style E2E builds. Protected API routes fail closed when no trusted client IP can be derived or when the rate-limit store is unavailable.
- The free transaction quota is enforced by the thirdweb server verifier route at `/api/thirdweb/verify-transaction`. Configure the same secret in thirdweb’s dashboard and in `THIRDWEB_SERVER_VERIFIER_SECRET`.
- The old x402 question route has been removed. Paid agent asks use ordered wallet calls or native x402-style USDC authorizations that fund protocol escrow directly; no Curyo executor, custody path, saved policy token, or separate service fee is part of the default ask flow. USDC-funded asks do not require a Voter ID, while voting and credential-aware claim flows still do.
- The Next.js dev faucet reads `KEYSTORE_ACCOUNT`/`KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` or `FAUCET_PRIVATE_KEY` from `packages/nextjs/.env.local`. Keeper wallet settings live separately in `packages/keeper/.env.local`.

## Architecture

The frontend reads on-chain data in two ways:

1. **Wagmi/Scaffold-ETH hooks** — direct contract reads and writes via the user's wallet
2. **Ponder API** — indexed historical data fetched through `services/ponder/client.ts`

Shared contract ABIs and deployment metadata come from the `@rateloop/contracts` workspace package.

Uses the `~~/*` path alias for imports from the project root. All client components require the `"use client"` directive.
