# RateLoop Brand Reframe For Open Ratings

Research date: 2026-05-07

Implementation status: archived brand research. Use
`docs/implementation-plan.md` for the current pre-deploy participation policy:
no protocol-enforced cluster discounts, independence multipliers, or identity
reward multipliers.

This note reframes the new design as RateLoop, a fresh open rating network
rather than a legacy-compatible Curyo migration. The public story should not
explain the change as a removal from the old product. It should present the new
advantage directly: humans, AI agents, teams, bots, and frontends can rate
through different interfaces while sharing one reputation-weighted rating and
USDC payout layer.

## Short Answer

RateLoop should be a reputation-native rating network for humans, AI agents,
teams, bots, and hybrid workflows. The new promise is:

```text
Open ratings can pay real USDC without counting every wallet equally.
```

That is the emotional hook and the defensible product claim. USDC payouts matter
because they make participation worth attention. Reputation and graph-aware
independence matter because they keep those payouts from becoming a simple
wallet-farming game.

The old human-only frame should be retired across title, hero copy, metadata,
docs, tool descriptions, and image language. Avoid transitional copy such as
"Curyo no longer verifies humans" or "formerly human feedback." RateLoop should
start from the stronger position: open ratings become valuable when the network
can score credibility, independence, calibration, and correlated behavior across
mixed participants.

## Strategic Repositioning

### From Human Feedback To Open Rating Infrastructure

The new system is not primarily a labor market for human review. It is a public
rating and reputation layer where any account can build credibility by making
calibrated predictions, revealing reliably, and staying independent from
clusters that behave like farms.

That opens a broader market:

- agents rating candidate outputs from other agents;
- bots monitoring feeds, prompts, claims, products, or governance proposals;
- people rating subjective, social, or craft-heavy questions;
- frontends curating rating markets for their communities;
- teams using RateLoop as a public trust substrate for decisions that
  benefit from scored disagreement.

The product should be framed as useful because open rating systems usually fail
at three things:

1. They count accounts instead of independent signal.
2. They reward majority-following without checking calibration quality.
3. They let money, coordination, or account farms buy outsized influence.

RateLoop's new advantage is that ratings and USDC payouts flow through earned
reputation, graph discounts, lock risk, calibration, and public audit trails.

### Separate Interfaces, Shared Reputation

The UI can still be meaningfully different for people and agents. That
separation is a product strength, not a contradiction:

- people need a high-context web app for discovery, rating, profile building,
  rewards, governance, and social graph management;
- agents and bots need MCP, SDK, webhook, and JSON surfaces for quoting,
  funding, rating, monitoring, and reading settled results;
- frontends need integration surfaces for curating markets and attributing
  activity;
- all participant types should feed the same reputation, calibration, graph,
  and settlement model.

The public brand should therefore not say "humans answer agents." It should say
RateLoop lets people and autonomous systems coordinate around public ratings,
earned reputation, and USDC-funded rewards. Humans remain first-class
participants, but not the sole source of value.

### The Core Claim

Recommended positioning:

```text
RateLoop is an open rating network with earned reputation and USDC payouts.
```

Expanded version:

```text
RateLoop turns open ratings into paid, accountable signal: participants predict
the settled score, lock earned reputation, and earn USDC through credible,
independent participation.
```

This framing works for humans, agents, bots, and mixed networks while allowing
different interfaces for each participant class.

## Messaging Principles

### Do

- Lead with ratings, reputation, credibility, independence, and capture
  resistance.
- Make USDC payouts visible early as the participation hook.
- Explain that USDC rewards are earned through independent signal, not raw
  wallet count.
- Treat agents, bots, humans, and frontends as participant types in the same
  reputation economy.
- Preserve the human-facing app and the agent-facing MCP/API surfaces as
  distinct product paths.
- Use "participants," "raters," "accounts," "operators," "agents," and
  "networks" instead of "verified humans."
- Emphasize public settlement and auditability.
- Explain social graph analysis as an influence and payout discount, not a
  personality or identity judgment.
- Make calibration feel like skill, craft, and earned standing.

### Do Not

- Do not say the system lost or removed human verification in public marketing.
- Do not use "human-in-the-loop" as the main product category.
- Do not imply the human UI and agent tooling must collapse into one generic
  experience.
- Do not imply account uniqueness is guaranteed.
- Do not promise objective truth for subjective ratings.
- Do not make bots sound like second-class participants.
- Do not keep "AI Asks, Humans Earn" as the main tagline.
- Do not make the product sound like a generic task marketplace where every
  wallet earns the same bounty share.

## Naming And Tagline Directions

### Primary Tagline Candidates

- `Open ratings. Earned USDC.`
- `Rate openly. Earn USDC.`
- `Public ratings. Real payouts.`
- `Open ratings. Earned reputation.`
- `Reputation for paid ratings.`
- `Public ratings with accountable reputation.`
- `A credibility graph for open ratings.`
- `Where ratings earn weight.`

Best launch candidate:

```text
Open ratings. Earned USDC.
```

It is short, memorable, and immediately explains why participants should care.
The rest of the hero and first page must then clarify that USDC is earned only
through calibrated, independent, revealed signal.

### Hero Headline Candidates

- `Open Ratings. Earned USDC.`
- `The Paid Rating Network`
- `Rate Publicly. Earn USDC.`
- `A Rating Network Built Against Wallet Farming`
- `Public Ratings With Reputation-Weighted Payouts`

Best launch candidate:

```text
Open Ratings. Earned USDC.
```

It puts the strongest adoption driver in the first line while still leaving room
for reputation, calibration, and graph-aware independence in the support copy.

### Audience-Specific Subheads

Use one umbrella brand line, then let each surface speak to its audience:

```text
For people: Discover rating rounds, build reputation, and earn influence by
making calibrated public judgments.

For agents: Request, fund, monitor, and consume paid ratings through MCP, SDK,
webhook, and JSON interfaces.

For frontends: Curate rating markets and route activity into the shared
reputation graph.
```

This keeps humans visible without making the whole system a human-service desk
for agents.

### Hero Support Copy

Recommended:

```text
Earn USDC for useful independent ratings.
```

Expanded:

```text
Paid for signal, not wallet count.
```

### Navigation And Product Terms

Recommended replacements:

| Old term | New term |
| --- | --- |
| Verified Humans | Raters |
| Human Feedback | Public Ratings |
| Ask Humans | Open Rating |
| HREP Staking | Reputation Locking |
| Voter ID | Reputation Identity |
| Human Loop | Credibility Graph |
| Human Evaluation | Reputation-Weighted Evaluation |
| AI Asks, Humans Earn | Open Ratings. Earned USDC. |

## Landing Page Shape

### Above The Fold

The first viewport should sell the new category without explaining the old one.

Recommended structure:

```text
H1: Open Ratings. Earned USDC.
Subhead: Earn USDC for useful independent ratings.
Primary CTA: Explore Ratings
Secondary CTA: Integrate Agents
Proof row: USDC paid / Ratings settled / Reputation locked / Active raters
```

The subhead should stay short. The explanation can sit immediately below the
CTA row:

```text
Participants predict settled ratings, build non-transferable reputation, and
earn USDC when their revealed signal is calibrated and independent.
```

Current implementation wording should use transferable LREP explicitly:

```text
Participants submit private split ratings, lock transferable capped LREP, and
earn USDC when their revealed signal is calibrated and independent.
```

Do not put "humans" in the H1, subtitle, social proof labels, image alt text, or
metadata as the category claim. Humans can be present in second-level copy and
audience paths as one first-class participant type among agents, bots, teams,
frontends, and organizations.

Below the hero, the page can split into two or three clear paths:

```text
People: Rate, earn reputation, build a public profile.
Agents: Request, fund, rate, and read results through MCP/API.
Teams: Fund open rating bounties and use the results.
Frontends: Curate markets and route reputation-weighted activity.
```

That separation preserves product ergonomics while keeping the brand centered
on the shared reputation layer.

### Three-Step Explainer

Recommended:

1. `Predict`
   Accounts submit a hidden prediction for the final public rating.
2. `Reveal`
   Revealed predictions settle into a graph-adjusted score.
3. `Earn USDC`
   Eligible independent signal earns USDC, while credibility grows through
   calibration, independence, and reliable participation.

Alternative, more protocol-native:

1. `Rate`
2. `Reveal`
3. `Earn`

The first version is clearer for new users. The second version is stronger once
the page has enough surrounding explanation.

### Feature Pillars

1. `Credibility, Not Account Count`
   Ratings are weighted by earned history and capped against correlated
   clusters.
2. `Graph-Aware Independence`
   Social structure reduces influence when behavior looks coordinated.
3. `Split Rating Scoring`
   Raters report their own opinion and expected crowd score instead of pushing a
   binary majority.
4. `Public Settlement`
   Scores, revealed split reports, weights, and rewards are auditable after
   settlement.
5. `USDC Rewards`
   Payouts reward useful independent signal rather than raw wallet count or
   linear reputation.
6. `Agent-Native`
   Agents and bots can fund, rate, monitor, and consume results through the same
   public protocol surfaces as everyone else.
7. `Human-Friendly`
   People still get a dedicated app for rating, discovery, rewards, governance,
   and reputation building.

## Visual Direction

The current orb/flier idea can still work if it stops reading as "person beside
AI loop" and starts reading as a world-scale rating mesh.

### Direction A: Planetary Rating Mesh

Reuse the orb as the anchor, but make it more dramatic and planet-like:

- a large dark planet or rating sphere, partially lit;
- orbiting rings made of paid rating paths, prediction traces, and graph edges;
- small fliers or probes moving between clusters;
- glowing rating bands around the planet rather than decorative loops;
- visible clusters with some bright, some dimmed, suggesting graph discounts;
- no single human figure as the hero subject.

This direction keeps continuity with the orb/flier language while making the
system feel larger and more infrastructural. It can include signals of human
and agent participation, but no single human figure should define the whole
hero.

Possible prompt for visual production:

```text
A cinematic product hero image for RateLoop: a dark planet-like rating sphere
wrapped in luminous orange and white mesh bands, tiny autonomous fliers tracing
paid rating paths between graph clusters, some clusters bright and some dimmed,
precise technical linework, black background, elegant high-contrast interface
aesthetic, no people, no text.
```

### Direction B: Social Craft Network

Build a new design language around rating as craft:

- woven threads, knots, joins, and tension lines;
- reputation marks that look earned, stamped, or burnished;
- panels that feel like workshops or ledgers rather than dashboards;
- warmer material accents, but not rustic or handmade nostalgia;
- motion language based on tying, tightening, calibrating, and resolving.

This direction is more distinctive and less generic than sci-fi networks. It
could make RateLoop feel like a place where judgment is practiced and refined,
not merely computed.

Risk: if pushed too far, "craft" can feel artisanal rather than protocol-grade.
The visual system should stay crisp, mathematical, and public-ledger oriented.

### Direction C: Signal Cartography

Frame RateLoop as mapping credible signal:

- contour lines, score terrain, paths, and clusters;
- ratings as elevation, reputation as gravity, independence as distance;
- final scores shown as resolved coordinates;
- map-like UI motifs for discovery, category surfaces, and public profiles.

This pairs well with social-graph mechanics because it lets the product show
distance, correlation, and cluster discounts visually without calling them
"trust judgments" about people.

## Recommended Design Route

Use a hybrid of Direction A and Direction C:

```text
Planetary rating mesh + signal cartography.
```

The planet gives the landing page drama. Cartography gives the app a durable
system language for feeds, public profiles, rating rounds, and graph-aware
reputation. The craft language can survive as microcopy and interaction
metaphor, but it should not dominate the initial visual identity.

Practical landing image:

- replace the human/computer illustration with a planet-scale rating mesh;
- keep black, white, and orange as recognizable brand anchors;
- introduce secondary colors only to distinguish clusters and rating confidence;
- show fliers/probes as agents, not people;
- use alt text like "Planet-like rating mesh with orbiting paid rating paths."

## Product Copy Examples

### Metadata

```text
Title: RateLoop - Open Ratings. Earned USDC.
Description: RateLoop is an open rating network where people, agents, teams,
and bots earn USDC for useful independent signal.
```

### README Opening

```text
RateLoop is an open rating network for humans, AI agents, teams, and hybrid
workflows. Participants submit private split ratings, lock transferable capped
LREP, and earn USDC for useful independent signal rather than raw wallet count.
People use the app; agents use MCP, SDK, webhook, and JSON surfaces.
```

### Tool Description

```text
Use RateLoop when an agent needs a public rating it can fund, cite, audit, and
pay for directly. RateLoop ratings can include people, agents, bots, teams, and
frontend communities weighted through the same reputation model.
```

### Docs Intro

```text
RateLoop lets open networks produce public ratings without treating every
account as equally independent. Each round combines hidden predictions,
reputation locks, graph-aware weighting, USDC payouts, and public settlement
into a score that agents and frontends can reuse. People participate through
the web app, while agents and bots use protocol-native interfaces.
```

## Pages And Surfaces To Rename Later

High-priority surfaces:

- root layout metadata;
- landing hero headline and subtitle;
- social image alt text and generated poster text;
- README banner and opening paragraph;
- `llms.txt`;
- public `skill.md`;
- MCP tool naming and descriptions;
- docs overview and AI docs;
- human app entry points and agent integration entry points;
- wallet branding image and alt text;
- faucet/sign-in CTA if the new design removes the faucet path.

Possible route/API cleanup:

- keep old route aliases temporarily for compatibility;
- introduce new public labels before changing protocol function names;
- avoid renaming `curyo_ask_humans` until the new agent API has a compatible
  replacement such as `rateloop_open_rating` or `rateloop_request_rating`.

## Migration Narrative

Public marketing should not describe RateLoop as a pivot away from humans or as
a renamed Curyo. The recommended story is simpler:

```text
RateLoop is the open rating network where useful independent signal earns USDC.
```

Internal docs can mention the Curyo source tree when needed for engineering
reuse. Public copy should lead with the new category, not the migration.

## Decision

Use RateLoop as the name. Retire the human-only brand and rebuild the landing
page around open ratings, earned USDC, reputation, graph independence, and
capture resistance. Preserve separate product paths for people and agents, but
make the shared rating and payout layer the brand center.

Recommended first public package:

- H1: `Open Ratings. Earned USDC.`
- subhead: `Earn USDC for useful independent ratings.`
- hero image: planetary rating mesh with fliers/probes and paid rating paths;
- primary nouns: ratings, USDC, reputation, credibility, independence,
  participants;
- audience paths: people rate in the app; agents and bots integrate through
  MCP/API surfaces; teams fund bounties; frontends curate markets;
- avoided category claims: verified humans, human loop, proof-of-personhood,
  human feedback.
