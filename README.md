Curyo is a verified human feedback layer for agents and people. In AI product terms, it is a human-in-the-loop (HITL) judgment layer: when software reaches a question it cannot answer with confidence, it can ask one focused question, attach source context, fund a bounty in HREP or Celo USDC, and get back a public signal from verified humans who stake HREP on their judgment.

The same question flow works for a person in the web app or an agent using MCP/SDK tooling with a funded wallet. A saved agent policy and bearer token are optional guardrails for managed agents, not a prerequisite for wallet-paid asks. Each ask carries explicit round settings, optional preview media, claimable rewards for eligible voters, and an auditable result that other agents and frontends can read later. Agent bounties are designed to fund protocol escrow from a user-controlled wallet or scoped agent wallet, without routing funds through the front-end operator.

## Background

AI agents are increasingly good at drafting, searching, and planning, but they still hit questions where local context, taste, evidence quality, or social judgment matters. Curyo turns those moments into public, paid feedback rounds instead of private polls or unstructured comment threads.

The core loop is:

1. **Ask** — submit a short question with a required context URL and optional image or YouTube preview.
2. **Fund** — attach a non-refundable bounty in HREP or Celo USDC.
3. **Vote** — verified humans stake HREP on whether the question's visible rating should move up or down.
4. **Settle** — commit-reveal voting keeps directions hidden through the blind phase, then the round resolves once the selected reveal and voter thresholds are met.
5. **Use** — agents and frontends read the settled score, revealed votes, optional feedback, and reward state from the public protocol surface.

Key pieces:

- **Question-First Submissions** — humans and agents use the same permissionless ask flow
- **Verified Human Voters** — one soulbound Voter ID NFT per verified human for voting and other identity-gated actions
- **Staked Judgment** — every vote requires a HREP stake as a conviction signal
- **tlock Commit-Reveal** — votes are encrypted with timelock encryption, commits bind explicit drand metadata (`targetRound`, `drandChainHash`), and malformed/non-armored ciphertexts are rejected on-chain
- **Governed Round Settings** — question creators choose blind phase, max duration, settlement voters, and voter cap inside governance bounds
- **Agent-Ready Integrations** — SDK helpers and MCP-shaped tools let agents quote, prepare wallet-signed submissions, track asks, and read results without taking operator custody of bounty funds or requiring a saved policy token
- **Bounties and Feedback Bonuses** — question and bundle bounties pay eligible revealed voters across configured settlement rounds, while optional USDC Feedback Bonuses can reward useful hidden notes after settlement
- **Frontend Attribution** — bounty accounting reserves the configured operator share for eligible frontend operators
- **Security Guardrails** — duplicate checks, moderation policy, and claim gating keep the submission surface narrow

## Architecture

Curyo is a monorepo with eight packages:

| Package               | Description                                                                              |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `packages/contracts`  | Shared ABIs and deployed-address metadata consumed by the app and services               |
| `packages/foundry`    | Solidity smart contracts, tests, and deployment scripts                                  |
| `packages/nextjs`     | Next.js frontend with in-app documentation at `/docs`                                    |
| `packages/sdk`        | Framework-agnostic frontend SDK for hosted reads, vote helpers, and frontend attribution |
| `packages/ponder`     | Ponder indexer for on-chain event processing and API                                     |
| `packages/keeper`     | Standalone keeper service for keeper-assisted round settlement                           |
| `packages/agents`     | Agent integration hub with runtime examples, question guidance, and operator utilities   |
| `packages/node-utils` | Shared Node.js utilities used by services and scripts                                    |

```
foundry    (compile) → deployments + artifacts
contracts  (shared)  → ABIs + deployed addresses for apps/services
node-utils (shared)  → keystore and other reusable Node helpers
sdk        (shared)  → hosted read client + vote/frontend integration helpers
ponder     (index)   → REST API at localhost:42069
nextjs     (frontend)→ reads contracts via thirdweb, wagmi, and the Ponder API
keeper     (service) → settles question rounds, finalizes reveal failures, cleans up unrevealed votes, marks dormant asks
```

Built with Next.js, Foundry, Ponder, thirdweb, wagmi, viem, Drizzle ORM, and PostgreSQL.

## Install

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js 24.x](https://nodejs.org/) via the repo's [`.nvmrc`](./.nvmrc) or [`.node-version`](./.node-version)
- Yarn v3 via Corepack (`corepack enable`)
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Noc2/CURYO.git
cd CURYO
corepack enable
yarn install
```

For Celo mainnet deployment, see [packages/foundry/README.md](packages/foundry/README.md).

## Usage

### Run Locally

The quickest app-only startup is:

```bash
yarn dev:stack
```

That command starts the Next app's local Postgres container, runs `db:push` for local databases, and then starts the frontend plus Ponder. If `DATABASE_URL` points to a non-local database, `yarn dev:stack` skips the schema push by default so it does not accidentally apply destructive Drizzle changes to shared data. Run `yarn workspace @curyo/nextjs db:push` manually when you intend to migrate that database, or opt in with `yarn dev:stack --allow-remote-db-push`.

If Keeper is configured with `RPC_URL`, `CHAIN_ID`, and a wallet, `yarn dev:stack` starts it too; otherwise the script skips Keeper and leaves the app stack running. Contract deployment stays separate, so you can point the stack at either a local chain or a testnet. Stop the local Postgres container later with:

```bash
yarn dev:db:down
```

If the local Postgres volume was initialized with old credentials, reset it with:

```bash
yarn dev:db:reset
```

If you are using a local chain, keep Anvil and deployment separate:

**1. Local chain:**

```bash
yarn chain
```

> The repo's chain helper starts Anvil with its default mining behavior. If you need automatic block production for long idle periods, start Anvil manually with a nonzero block time before running `yarn dev:stack`.

**2. Deploy contracts:**

```bash
yarn deploy
```

**3. Start the app stack:**

```bash
yarn dev:stack
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

If you only want the database helper, use `yarn dev:db`. It starts the local Postgres container without the other services.

### Run the Keeper

The keeper is a lightweight stateless service that calls settleRound() on eligible active rounds, cancels expired rounds, and marks dormant content. Anyone can run a keeper — all data is public, and multiple instances provide redundancy with no coordination.

**Configure** by copying `.env.example` and setting contract addresses and a wallet:

```bash
cp packages/keeper/.env.example packages/keeper/.env.local
# Edit packages/keeper/.env.local with your RPC URL, contract addresses, and wallet key
```

**Start the keeper:**

```bash
# Development (with file watching)
yarn keeper:dev

# Production
yarn keeper:start
```

**Docker:**

```bash
docker build -f packages/keeper/Dockerfile -t curyo-keeper .
docker run --env-file packages/keeper/.env.local -p 9090:9090 curyo-keeper
```

**Monitoring:**

- Prometheus metrics: `http://localhost:9090/metrics`
- Health check: `http://localhost:9090/health`

**Redundancy:** Run 2+ instances with different wallets and `KEEPER_STARTUP_JITTER_MS=15000` to stagger execution. Duplicate transactions revert harmlessly.

### Run Tests

```bash
# TypeScript / Node test suites across app + services
yarn test:ts

# Solidity unit tests
yarn foundry:test

# E2E smoke suite (Chromium only)
yarn e2e

# E2E lifecycle coverage (settlement, cancellation, dormancy)
yarn workspace @curyo/nextjs e2e:ci:lifecycle

# E2E keeper-backed settlement coverage
yarn workspace @curyo/nextjs e2e:ci:keeper

# Full local E2E run
yarn workspace @curyo/nextjs e2e:full

# Interactive Playwright UI mode
yarn e2e:ui
```

CI runs the smoke, lifecycle, and keeper-backed E2E suites separately, so `yarn e2e` alone does not match full CI browser coverage.

### Run the Dead-Code Scan

Run the Knip dead-code scan with:

```bash
yarn dead-code
```

This repo uses Yarn's `node-modules` linker, so `yarn dead-code` performs an immutable `skip-build` relink to restore `node_modules/.yarn-state.yml` only when that file is missing (e.g. fresh clone). When the file is already present the scan starts immediately. Any extra arguments after `yarn dead-code` are forwarded to Knip.

## Docs and APIs

In-app documentation is available at `/docs` when running the frontend. The `/docs/ai` page covers the AI integration shape, non-custodial agent-wallet submissions, governed per-question round settings, the agent-to-human feedback loop, and how agents ask humans for judgment through the same submission path as everyone else.

For app integrations, the framework-agnostic SDK lives in `packages/sdk` and provides hosted/indexed reads, vote/frontend helpers, and agent helpers for quote → ask → wait → result flows.

Additional local interface:

- Ponder REST API at `http://localhost:42069` after `yarn ponder:dev`
